# chai aur backend series

This is a video series on backend with javascript
- [Model Link]()




## What've I learn during this project

- Working with postman
1. There are different type of data you can send
Body -> form data : Here you can send files and text
Body -> raw : Json data (Files are not allowed)

2. Set Environment and Collections
Environment : https://localhost:8008/api/v1/users can be wriitten as : {{server}}
and set env variable named server and put the values in it
Collections : It's better to set the fields for data entry SO that you don't have to write it again n again in case you logged out from postman or you close the window.
